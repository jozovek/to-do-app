# Todo App Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This todo app project exists as a personal learning and development exercise to demonstrate the ability to build and deploy a functional web application. It serves as a practical implementation of Vue.js concepts and web development skills.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Task Management**: Helps users keep track of their tasks in one centralized location
2. **Organization**: Allows categorization of tasks (work, personal, errands) for better organization
3. **Prioritization**: Enables setting due dates to prioritize tasks based on deadlines
4. **Progress Tracking**: Provides visual feedback on task completion status
5. **Calendar Integration**: Allows exporting tasks to calendar applications for better time management

## How It Should Work
The application should provide a simple, intuitive interface where users can:
1. Easily add new tasks with descriptions, categories, and due dates
2. View all their tasks in a clean, organized list
3. Filter tasks based on completion status (All, Active, Completed)
4. Mark tasks as complete with a simple checkbox interaction
5. Edit existing tasks to update details
6. Delete tasks that are no longer needed
7. Export tasks to calendar format for integration with external calendar applications

The application should maintain state between sessions using localStorage, ensuring that users don't lose their tasks when they close and reopen the browser.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean and uncluttered, focusing on the essential functionality
2. **Efficiency**: Users should be able to add and manage tasks with minimal clicks and interactions
3. **Clarity**: Task status, categories, and due dates should be clearly visible at a glance
4. **Responsiveness**: The application should work well on different screen sizes
5. **Reliability**: Tasks should be saved automatically and persist between sessions

## Target Users
The primary users of this application are:
1. Individuals looking for a simple task management solution
2. People who prefer web-based applications over native applications
3. Users who need basic task organization without complex project management features

## Success Metrics
From a user perspective, the application will be successful if it:
1. Allows users to manage their tasks without confusion or frustration
2. Provides a reliable way to store and retrieve tasks
3. Makes it easy to see what tasks are pending and what has been completed
4. Integrates with their existing calendar system through exports
