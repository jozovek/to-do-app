# Todo App Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on setting up the initial project structure and environment for the Todo App. This includes:

1. Creating the basic project structure using Vue.js and Vite
2. Setting up the Memory Bank documentation system
3. Preparing the directory structure for components, composables, and utilities
4. Establishing the foundation for future development

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup with Vue.js and Vite
- Creation of Memory Bank documentation files
- Establishment of project directory structure

## Next Steps
1. Create the core components:
   - TodoForm.vue for adding new tasks
   - TodoItem.vue for displaying individual tasks
   - TodoList.vue for showing the list of tasks

2. Implement the state management:
   - Create useTodos.js composable for managing todo items
   - Implement localStorage persistence

3. Develop the calendar export functionality:
   - Create calendarExport.js utility for exporting tasks to .ics format

4. Update App.vue to integrate all components and manage application state

5. Style the application using plain CSS

## Completed Tasks
- Implemented natural language input using SmartInput.vue and updated TodoForm.vue

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Component Structure
- Using single-file components (.vue) for all UI elements
- Following a container/presentational pattern with App.vue as the main container
- Keeping components focused on single responsibilities

### State Management
- Using Vue's Composition API with composables instead of Vuex
- Centralizing todo state management in useTodos.js
- Implementing localStorage for persistence between sessions

### Styling Approach
- Using plain CSS without frameworks to keep the project lightweight
- Scoping styles to components where appropriate
- Using CSS variables for consistent theming

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- Using the Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Following Vue 3 best practices for reactivity and component design
- Using ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals

### Component Communication
- Props for parent-to-child communication
- Events for child-to-parent communication
- Avoiding global state when possible

### File Organization
- Keeping related files together in appropriate directories
- Using clear, descriptive file names
- Following the "one file, one purpose" principle

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is designed to be simple and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity
- The component-based architecture allows for easy maintenance and extension
- Using localStorage provides a simple solution for data persistence without requiring a backend
- The Memory Bank documentation system helps maintain context and understanding of the project
