## Current Status
The authentication system is now fully functional with working Register and Login buttons. Both frontend and backend servers are running successfully. The project has evolved beyond the initial setup phase to include a complete user authentication system with proper error handling and user feedback.

**DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION COMPLETED (2025-06-16)**: The application is now ready for production deployment with backend on Render and frontend on Netlify. All necessary configuration files and environment handling have been implemented.

### Deployment Preparation Work (2025-06-16)
- **Problem**: Friend encountered "Network error" and 404 API errors when trying to use the deployed app
- **Root Cause**: Only frontend was deployed to Netlify, but backend server was not deployed anywhere
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Environment-aware API configuration**: Updated `src/services/api.js` to use different API URLs for development vs production
  2. **Production CORS setup**: Updated `backend/server.js` with proper CORS configuration for production
  3. **Environment documentation**: Created `backend/.env.example` with all required environment variables
  4. **Render configuration**: Created `render.yaml` for easy Render deployment
  5. **Comprehensive deployment guide**: Created `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with step-by-step instructions

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/services/api.js`: Environment-aware API URL configuration
  - `backend/server.js`: Production CORS settings
  - `backend/.env.example`: Environment variables template
  - `render.yaml`: Render deployment configuration
  - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Complete deployment instructions

- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
  - **Backend**: Render (free tier with cold starts)
  - **Frontend**: Netlify (existing deployment, needs environment variable update)
  - **Environment Variables**: Properly configured for production vs development

## Known Issues
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Server-side bcrypt password comparison issue - was caused by corrupted user data, now fixed
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Deployment architecture mismatch - frontend and backend deployment strategy now properly configured
- Need to complete the todo functionality (TodoForm, TodoItem, TodoList components)

## Recent Fixes (2025-06-11)
### Button Functionality Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: Register and Login buttons were not working
- **Root Causes**:
  1. LoginForm.vue had incorrect API endpoint (`/backend/login` instead of `/api/auth/login`)
  2. LoginForm.vue was not emitting `login-success` event to parent component
  3. Missing Vite proxy configuration for API routing
  4. Poor user feedback and error handling in both forms

- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. Fixed API endpoint in LoginForm.vue to use correct `/api/auth/login`
  2. Added proper event emission with `defineEmits(['login-success'])`
  3. Configured Vite proxy to route `/api` requests to backend server (port 3000)
  4. Enhanced both forms with:
     - Loading states and disabled buttons during requests
     - Error message displays with proper styling
     - Success message for registration
     - Form validation and user feedback
     - Improved styling with scoped CSS

- **Testing Results**:
  - ✅ Registration button: Successfully makes API calls, shows "User already exists" error appropriately
  - ✅ Login button: Successfully makes API calls, shows error messages properly
  - ✅ Form validation: Both forms validate input and provide user feedback
  - ✅ API communication: Frontend properly communicates with backend through proxy

### Bcrypt Login Issue Resolution (2025-06-11)
- **Problem**: Login attempts were failing with bcrypt error "data and hash arguments required"
- **Root Cause Investigation**:
  1. Added comprehensive debug logging to login route
  2. Discovered that user records in database had `undefined` password fields
  3. Found 2 corrupted users: `jozovek@gmail.com` and `test@example.com`
  4. The bcrypt.compare() function was being called with `undefined` hash parameter

- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. Created database cleanup script (`backend/scripts/fixUserPasswords.js`)
  2. Script identifies users with missing/null password fields
  3. Removed corrupted user records from database
  4. Added data integrity check in login route to prevent future issues
  5. Tested complete registration → login flow with fresh user

- **Final Testing Results**:
  - ✅ User registration: Creates proper bcrypt password hash
  - ✅ User login: Successfully compares password with hash
  - ✅ Authentication flow: Complete login → todo app transition working
  - ✅ Session management: JWT tokens and user sessions functional
  - ✅ Error handling: Proper error messages for invalid credentials

### Registration Route Hardening (2025-06-11)
- **Problem**: Registration route could potentially create users with corrupted password hashes
- **Root Cause**: No validation that bcrypt.hash() operation succeeded before user creation
- **Solution Implemented**: Added password hash validation in registration route
  ```javascript
  // Validate that password hashing succeeded
  if (!hashedPassword || typeof hashedPassword !== 'string' || hashedPassword.length < 10) {
    console.error('Password hashing failed for user:', email);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Password processing failed. Please try again.' });
  }
  ```
- **Prevention**: This ensures users can only be created with valid password hashes, preventing future bcrypt comparison errors
- **Benefits**: 
  - Fails fast if password hashing fails
  - Provides clear error message to users
  - Logs failures for debugging
  - Prevents database corruption at the source

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### 2025-05-12: Initial Project Setup
- **Decision**: Use Vue.js with Vite for the frontend framework and build tool
  - **Rationale**: Vue.js provides a lightweight, component-based approach that's ideal for this application. Vite offers fast development and build times.
  - **Alternatives Considered**: React, Angular, Svelte
  - **Outcome**: Project initialized with Vue.js and Vite

- **Decision**: Use plain CSS for styling
  - **Rationale**: Keeps the project simple and lightweight
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Tailwind CSS, SCSS, CSS-in-JS
  - **Outcome**: Project set up with plain CSS

- **Decision**: Use localStorage for data persistence
  - **Rationale**: Simple solution that doesn't require a backend server
  - **Alternatives Considered**: IndexedDB, Firebase
  - **Outcome**: Plan to implement localStorage in useTodos.js

- **Decision**: Use Composition API with composables for state management
  - **Rationale**: Provides a clean way to organize and reuse logic without the complexity of Vuex
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Vuex, Pinia
  - **Outcome**: Plan to implement useTodos.js composable

- **Decision**: No testing framework for initial MVP
  - **Rationale**: Keep the project simple for the initial version
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Vitest, Jest, Cypress
  - **Outcome**: Will rely on manual testing for the MVP

- **Decision**: Deploy to Netlify
  - **Rationale**: Simple deployment process with free hosting for personal projects
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Vercel, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting
  - **Outcome**: Plan to deploy to Netlify when the project is ready
