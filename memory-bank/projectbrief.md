# Todo App Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a simple to-do web application built with Vue.js and Vite. The goal is to create a functional, minimalist to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

## Core Requirements
1. Create, read, update, and delete tasks
2. Mark tasks as complete
3. Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
4. Categorize tasks (work, personal, errands)
5. Set due dates for tasks
6. Export tasks to calendar format (.ics)
7. Store tasks in localStorage for persistence

## Technical Stack
- Frontend Framework: Vue.js
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Plain CSS
- State Management: Vue's Composition API with localStorage
- Deployment: Netlify
